            <h4>What is a Cryptid?</h4>
            <p>A cryptid is a creature that is said to exist but has never been proven. No, we are not crazy, don't say that around Guk either. Ever heard of bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, or Freddy Fazbear? These are all examples of cryptids. Guk might be one too, we don't know and we don't want to know. </p>

            <h4>Who is Guk?</h4>
            <p>Guk is a man (I think) who needs no introduction. He is the man you've all been waiting for and thinking of. He is in your dreams and nightmares. He is in your fantasies and darkest thoughts. You don't know him but he knows you, and he wants your money. Do not shine bright lights around Guk, do not mention Reddit, and do not hold any shiny objects in front of him. </p>
